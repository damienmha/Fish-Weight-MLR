# Fish-Weight-MLR

#### Research Question 
In this study, we constructed predictive model to study how various measurements of length (such as width and height) affect the weight of fish.

#### Background / Source of Data 
Fish weight is a critical factor in fisheries science and management due to its value in explaining the growth and living condition of fish populations. We pulled data from Kaggle that recorded seven common different fish species in fish market sales. We then built a multiple linear regression model to predict the weight of fish based on up to five explanatory variables of fish length. Using the standard relative weight for each fish, we can evaluate the health of fisheries, such as whether they are properly managed and whether the number of competing predators is stable.

#### Methodology / Paper Overview 
We will first conduct a preliminary analysis to observe any relationships among the variables. Then, we will fit a multiple least squares linear regression model using all the variables and observe whether any assumptions are violated. If so, we will transform the data and refit the model. If necessary, we will then consider model selection criteria to remove redundant variables from our model. After deciding on the best model, we will interpret the result and provide analysis, including the real life application of fish weight on fisheries' health.
